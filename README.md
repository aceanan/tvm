# Pytorch TVM Extension

Please note that this is a work in progress.


## Build

For improved performance, you'll need to build PyTorch on top of this PR: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/20284
```
cd pytorch
git fetch origin pull/20284/head:tvm_dev
git checkout tvm_dev
python setup.py install
```

Otherwise, install the latest Nightly build of PyTorch.

Then, build this repo
```
# Make sure the right llvm-config is in your PATH
python setup.py install
```

## Test

```
python setup.py test 
```

## Usage

This package transparently hooks into PyTorch's JIT, so the same tooling is applicable (see `@torch.jit.script`, `torch.jit.trace` and `graph_for`).  See below for an example.

```
import torch_tvm

torch_tvm.enable()

# The following function will be compiled with TVM
@torch.jit.script
def my_func(a, b, c):
    return a * b + c
```

To disable the JIT hooks, use `torch_tvm.disable()`.

## Code Layout

- `register.cpp`: Sets up pybind bindings and invokes the registration of a TVM backend.
- `compiler.{h,cpp}`: Main logic to compile a PyTorch JIT graph with TVM.
- `operators.{h,cpp}`: Location of mapping from JIT IR to TVM operators.
